										<p>Given the far-reaching nature of the climate challenge, effective federal policy is needed to achieve deep, long-term reductions in  greenhouse gas emissions, and to help strengthen climate resilience.</p>
										<p> The US Government research and development programs, such as the Advanced Research Project Agency-Energy,  drive progress in clean energy technologies and bring them to commercial use. Voluntary programs, like the Natural Gas STAR program, also work with businesses to reduce emissions, often with public recognition.</p>
										<p>Traditional regulations set by the government, such as fuel efficiency and emissions standards for cars and trucks, require companies to increase energy efficiency or reduce emissions in their own operations or in the goods they produce.
											Market-based programs that put a price on carbon emissions, such as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade program, require emission reductions but let the private sector determine the most cost-effective way to achieve them.</p>
										<p>The govts hasve taken a wide variety of steps inorder to prevent solution but these efforts are sadly not enough.Much more must be done to stop climate change and save our planet from the threat thatâ€™s right under our noses.</p>
