								<p>Global warming is expected to have far-reaching, long-lasting and, in many cases, devastating consequences for planet Earth. Here is an in-depth look at the changes wrought by global warming.</p>
								<ol>
									<li><h4>Increase in average temperatures and temperature extremes</h4>
										One of the most immediate and obvious effects of global warming is the increase in temperatures around the world. The average global temperature has increased by about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius) over the past 100 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</li><br>
									<li><h4>Extreme weather events</h4>
										Changes in climate can cause the polar jet stream — the boundary between the cold North Pole air and the warm equatorial air — to migrate south, bringing with it cold, Arctic air. This is why some states can have a sudden cold snap or colder-than-normal winter, even during the long-term trend of global warming</li><br>
									<li><h4>Ice melt</h4>
										The melting of the polar ice caps is yet another common effect of global causing the rise in sea level. One of the most dramatic effects of global warming is the reduction in Arctic sea ice. Sea ice hit record-low extents in both the fall and winter of 2015 and 2016, meaning that at the time when the ice is supposed to be at its peak, it was lagging.</li><br>
									<li><h4>Plants and animals</h4>
										The effects of global warming on the Earth's ecosystems are expected to be profound and widespread. Many species of plants and animals are already moving their range northward or to higher altitudes as a result of warming temperatures, according to a report from the National Academy of Sciences.</li><br>
									<li><h4>Social effects</h4>
										As dramatic as the effects of climate change are expected to be on the natural world, the projected changes to human society may be even more devastating.
										Agricultural systems will likely be dealt a crippling blow. Though growing seasons in some areas will expand, the combined impacts of drought, severe weather, lack of accumulated snowmelt, greater number and diversity of pests, lower groundwater tables and a loss of arable land could cause severe crop failures and livestock shortages worldwide.</li>
