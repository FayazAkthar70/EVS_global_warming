							<h2>Evidence of Climate Change</h2>
							<p>Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era — and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth’s 
								orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives. We have analysed data over the last few decades to find patterns in climate change and visualised them. <br><ul class="actions">

									</header>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p> Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere and do 
										not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are 
										described as "forcing" climate change. Gases, such as water vapor, 
										which respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are 
										seen as "feedbacks."

								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>It's reasonable to assume that changes in the Sun's energy output 
										would cause the climate to change, since the Sun is the 
										fundamental source of energy that drives our climate system.</p>

									<h3>Plant trees</h3>
									<p>Trees absorb carbon dioxide (reminder: which makes up 82% of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere), so planting more trees can help reduce the amount of carbon in our atmosphere. </p>
								</section>
								<section class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-xsmall">
									<span class="icon solid alt major fa-car"></span>
									<h3>Use sustainable transportation</h3>
									<p>Cars are one of the biggest contributors to climate change. Tweak a few habits that will have a bigger collective impact. For example, if you refrain from harsh braking and rapid acceleration, you can cut your fuel consumption by as much as 40%. </p>
								</section>
								<section class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-xsmall">
									<span class="icon solid alt major fa-fire"></span>
									<h3>Lower your heating bill</h3>
									<p>Electricity is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gas emissions, and heating systems are the single biggest energy expense in the home. So lowering your heating bills is the most impactful way to reduce your electricity consumption</p>
								</section>
								<section class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-xsmall">
									<span class="icon solid alt major fa-industry"></span>
									<h3>Divest from coal</h3>
									<p>Coal-burning power plants are by far the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. There are many renewable sources of energy like solar and wind these days. </p>
								</section>
								<section class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-xsmall">
									<span class="icon solid alt major fa-leaf "></span>
									<h3>Behave sustainably</h3>
									<p>Power your home with renewable energy ,invest in energy efficient appliances etc.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-xsmall">
									<span class="icon solid alt major fa-recycle "></span>
									<h3>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</h3>
									<p>Reducing your need to buy new products results in a smaller amount of waste. Even if you need to buy, consider buying eco-friendly products. It is the most effective of the three R’s. It simply says cut back from where are you now.</p>
